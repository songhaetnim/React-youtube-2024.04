        "description": "There are infinite realities. This is the one where Jason Dessen kidnaps himself. Based on the New York Times bestseller, Dark Matter premieres May 8. https://apple.co/_DarkMatter\n\nDark Matter is a sci-fi thriller series based on the blockbuster book by acclaimed, bestselling author Blake Crouch. The nine-episode series features an ensemble cast that includes Joel Edgerton, Jennifer Connelly, Alice Braga, Jimmi Simpson, Dayo Okeniyi and Oakes Fegley. Dark Matter makes its global debut on Apple TV+ on May 8, 2024, premiering with the first two episodes, followed by new episodes every Wednesday through June 26.\n\nHailed as one of the best sci-fi novels of the decade, Dark Matter is a story about the road not taken. The series will follow Jason Dessen (played by Joel Edgerton), a physicist, professor and family man who — one night while walking home on the streets of Chicago — is abducted into an alternate version of his life. Wonder quickly turns to nightmare when he tries to return to his reality amid the mind-bending landscape of lives he could have lived. In this labyrinth of realities, he embarks on a harrowing journey to get back to his true family and save them from the most terrifying, unbeatable foe imaginable: himself.\n\nCrouch serves as executive producer, showrunner, and writer alongside executive producers Matt Tolmach and David Manpearl for Matt Tolmach Productions, and Joel Edgerton.

His frame was made of steel and powered by pneumatics, thanks to the help of Hallucinations Creations who make amazing pneumatic animatronic mechs for the haunted house industry. We used wire, duct tape, and foam to make the shape of his body and covered the whole thing in shaggy fur. His head was custom 3D modeled and 3D printed. The whole thing was animated with a prop controller from Purgatory Props.\n\nWe love how our real life DogDay turned out! He’s an awesome pneumatic prop and he's going to make the perfect companion to our growing collection of custom Halloween animatronics like our Catnap, Huggy Wuggy and Springtrap animatronics. Who do you want to see us make next? And where do we put this giant prop now?!\n\nThanks for watching and Stay Wicked, y’all!\n\n#DogDay\n#PoppyPlaytime\n#Animatronics",

Hear no evil.\n#SpeakNoEvilMovie only in theaters September 13.  \n\n-----\n\nWhen an American family is invited to spend the weekend at the idyllic country estate of a charming British family they befriended on vacation, what begins as a dream holiday soon warps into a snarled psychological nightmare. \n\nFrom Blumhouse, the producer of The Black Phone, Get Out and The Invisible Man, comes an intense suspense thriller for our modern age, starring BAFTA award-winner James McAvoy (Split, Glass) in a riveting performance as the charismatic, alpha-male estate owner whose untrammeled hospitality masks an unspeakable darkness. \n\nSpeak No Evil stars Mackenzie Davis (Terminator: Dark Fate, Halt and Catch Fire) and SAG award-winner Scoot McNairy (Argo, A Quiet Place Part II) as American couple Louise and Ben Dalton, who, along with their 11-year-old daughter Agnes (Alix West Lefler; The Good Nurse, Riverdale), accept the weekend-holiday invitation of Paddy (McAvoy), his wife Ciara (Aisling Franciosi; Game of Thrones, The Fall) and their furtive, mute son Ant (newcomer Daniel Hough).\n\nWritten for the screen and directed by James Watkins, the writer-director of Eden Lake and the award-winning gothic ghost story The Woman in Black, Speak No Evil is based on the screenplay of the 2022 Danish horror sensation Gæsterne, written by Christian Tafdrup and Mads Tafdrup. That film earned 11 Danish Film Awards nominations, the Danish equivalent of the Oscars. \n\nSpeak No Evil is produced by Jason Blum (Five Nights at Freddy’s, M3GAN) for Blumhouse and by Paul Ritchie (McMafia, The Ipcress File) and is executive produced by Beatriz Sequeira for Blumhouse, Jacob Jarek and Christian Tafdrup. \n\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/speaknoevilthefilm   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/speaknoevilthemovie/\nX: https://twitter.com/speaknoevil24\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics \nWebsite: https://www.speaknoevilmovie.com/",
